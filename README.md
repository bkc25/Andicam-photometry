# Andicam Optical/NIR photometry pipeline for point-like sources

This module is developed to perform point source photometry on images collected with the ANDICAM onboard the CTIO 1.3m telescope. Both aperture and psf techniques are possible. 

SMARTSOpt.py is the main photometry module and SOptfull.py is a wrapper.
