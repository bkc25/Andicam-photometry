# Andicam NIR module

This module is developed to process the near-infrared data from ANDICAM on the CTIO 1.3m telescope. The functions in this module are specifically designed to process the images that contain Galactic black hole X-ray binaries. These systems are point sources that, in general, do not lie in extremely crowded regions. Hence, this module can be used to process similar fields.
